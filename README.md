* Web App ERP for small companies, notably machine builders.
* It was developed for a previous company I worked for. I have been using to track and control my own side projects.
* It uses ASP.net/Framework 4.8, an Access DB, and HMTL5.
* It has modules for inventory control, timetracker, invoicing, project management, purchase orders and bill of materials.
